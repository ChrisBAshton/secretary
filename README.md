# Reviews plugin

WordPress plugin for creating and rendering reviews.

Originally built for [VoiceCouncil](http://voicecouncil.com) and encapsulated in the [VoiceCouncil Utilities](https://github.com/Webdapper/voicecouncil-utilities) plugin (until v1.17).

Before v0.2.0, this was primarily an 'App Reviews' plugin. From v0.2.0 onwards, it was genericised to be a 'Reviews' plugin that could be reused across products and across sites.

# Setup
`composer install`

(Downloads all required dependencies, saves to a `vendor` directory).
